QASP - Question answering using Semantic Primes
====

A tool to perform question answering using a Natural Semantic Meta-Language (NSM) and a knowledge node based Knowledge Representation System.

The tool provides a Graphical User Interface for a user to converse with the system. If an input sentence is not a query, the system parses it and stores the concepts in that sentence in its memory. If the input sentence is a query, a relevance-based searching algorithm is applied and the most accurate answer(s) is/are output.

For more information, see the following documents:

1. An Overview of the Initial Design for the QASP Tool - This is a design document describing the design for QASP.

2. Question Answering using a Natural Semantic Meta-Language and a knowledge node based Knowledge Representation system - This document describes the theory behind the tool.

I will post links to these documents soon.
